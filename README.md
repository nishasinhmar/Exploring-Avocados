# Exploring-Avocados
It is a well known fact that Millenials LOVE Avocado Toast. It's also a well known fact that all Millenials live in their parents basements.

Clearly, they aren't buying home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast!

The world avocado production is as follows:

But maybe there's hope... if a Millenial could find a city with cheap avocados, they could live out the Millenial American Dream.

This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV.

The table in the csv represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

There are some basic visualisations for the avocados using matplotlib, pylab and seaborn.
